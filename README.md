# image2ascii
A simple program that reads in a 24bit BitMap and produces an equivalent ascii representation, with 6 colors (in order to maintain compatibility with as many terminal emulators as possible)
# Usage
Include the header file, init a blank image and the load the image from a file, as seen in main. I highly suggest having a dedicated images directory.
# notes
In its current state, it is very simple. I plan to expand upon it for an upcoming project. The image translation works better on "simpler" images, ones whos colors/borders are distinct.
